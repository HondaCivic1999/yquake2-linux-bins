    <p><font size="2">Please note: Before installing Direct X, be warned that doing so has
    been known to do unusual things to computer it's being installed on. Direct X is a
    MICROSOFT product and is an extension to your Operating System, Windows 95 or NT, it is
    not an id Software product.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">During the Quake II installation process the installer will determine if
    Microsoft DirectX 8 needs to be installed on your computer. If so, the Microsoft DirectX
    8 setup program will ask you whether you would like to install the appropriate files on your
    computer. If you choose not to install DirectX 8, and you find that later you need to
    install DirectX 8, follow these directions. With the Quake II disc in your CD-ROM drive,
    install Microsoft DirectX 8 by right mouse clicking on the Quake II CD icon to get the
    Context menu. From that menu, select Install DirectX.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Quake II utilizes the DirectDraw and DirectSound components of DirectX.
    Certain full-screen video modes in Quake II are only available if DirectDraw is installed
    ON YOUR SYSTEM.<br>

    size="2"><br>
    </strong>Microsoft created DirectX. If the answer to the question you are looking for is
    not found on this page, you may want to contact Microsoft via mail at:<br>

    Microsoft Customer Sales and Service<br>
    One Microsoft Way<br>
    Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA<br>
    <br>
    Microsoft can also be reached in the USA at (800) 426-9400, or internationally at +1(206)

    <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>What is DirectX and why do I need it?</font><font
    size="2"><br>
    </strong>Microsoft's DirectX 8 is an API (Application Programming Interface) set that
    increases the speed at which games play under the Windows 95 operating system. These APIs
    allow direct access to the enhanced features of hardware under Windows 95. With DirectX
    8,
    a program has instant access to the hardware, allowing for advances in graphics, sound,
    video, 3-D, and network capabilities of games.<br>
    <br>
    Since Windows 95 and DirectX 8 are relatively new in the computer world and have not
    achieved compatibility with some older video cards, many manufacturers are releasing
    updated drivers for Windows 95 to meet the DirectX standard. If you are not sure about
    your video card's compatibility, consult the company that makes your video card.<br>
    <br>
    If the Microsoft DirectX Installer does not detect DirectX 8 on your computer, it can
    install DirectX 8 for you. After installation is complete, you will need to restart your
    computer in order for DirectX 8 to take effect.<br>
    <br>
    If you have other Windows 95 games on your computer, chances are you already have an
    earlier version of DirectX installed on your computer. In this case, if you choose to
    install DirectX the Microsoft Installer will overwrite that version with DirectX
    8. The
    DirectX installation process will then be complete. You will need to restart your computer
    for the changes to take effect.<br>
    <br>
    If you already have DirectX 8 installed on your computer, the Microsoft DirectX
    8 installer will detect it and not overwrite any DirectX 8 files. You will not need to
    restart your computer after installation in order to run Quake II.<br>
    <br>
    DirectX 8 should not affect any titles designed for the original version of DirectX.
    Should you encounter difficulties with DirectX 8, please contact Microsoft for further
    information. <br>

    <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>How do I check to see if my computer supports
    DirectX?</font><font size="2"><br>
    </strong>1. Place the disc in the CD-ROM drive and exit from any AutoPlay screens.<br>
    2. Double-click on &quot;My Computer&quot;.<br>
    3. Right-click on your CD-ROM drive and choose Install DirectX.<br>
    <br>
    If any of the components of DirectX are not certified, please call your hardware
    manufacturer for the updated drivers that support DirectX.<br>

    <p><font size="2"><em>Here is a list of common questions and answers people have regarding
    Direct X.</em><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Q: I am having problems running Quake II and
    think it might be related to my Direct X installation. What should I do?</font><font
    size="2"><br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial">A:</font><font size="2"> </strong>If you experience
    problems running Quake II, try turning off the &quot;Enable 3D Acceleration&quot; option
    in the DirectX setup program. To disable 3D Acceleration, double click on the dxsetup icon
    located in Program Files\DirectX\Setup. Uncheck the option for 3D acceleration in the
    middle of the DXSetup window.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Q: I have heard DirectX is not compatible with
    some video cards. What can you tell me about that?<br>
    A:</font><font size="2"> </strong>Windows 95 and DirectX are relatively new in the
    computer world and have not achieved compatibility with some older video cards. Many
    manufacturers are releasing updated drivers to meet the DirectX standard.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Q: If I don't have DirectX, will Quake II
    install it for me?<br>
    A: </strong></font><font size="2">Yes. If the Microsoft DirectX Installer does not detect
    DirectX on your computer, it will give you the option to install DirectX. After
    installation is complete, you will need to restart your computer in order for DirectX to
    take effect.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Q: If the DirectX Installer copied over a
    previous version, will the UnInstaller remove DirectX 8? How will this affect my other
    Windows 95 games?<br>
    A: </strong></font><font size="2">DirectX 8 will remain on your computer and you will be
    able to run other Windows 95 games that use Microsoft's DirectX libraries. DirectX
    8 should not affect any titles designed for the original version of DirectX. Should you
    encounter difficulties with DirectX 8, please contact Microsoft for further information
    (address and phone number listed above).<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Q: How do I restore my video and/or audio
    drivers once DirectX has been installed?<br>
    A:</strong></font><font size="2"><br>
    1. Place the disc in the CD-ROM drive and exit from any AutoPlay screens.<br>
    2. Double-click on &quot;My Computer&quot;.<br>
    3. Right-click on your CD-ROM drive and choose Install DirectX.<br>
    4. Choose the button that satisfies your need (e.g. Restore Audio drivers). This process
    will install your previous drivers and prompt you to restart Microsoft Windows.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2"><br>
    If you need further assistance, please contact your video card manufacturer directly.<br>
    </font></p>
    <p><font size="2">Quake II is designed to take advantage of whatever enhanced video,
    sound, and input capabilities (such as DirectX or VESA VBE video modes) are present, but
    has fallback functionality so it can run on any Win95 or NT 4.0 or later system, even if
    neither DirectX nor VESA VBE is available. You may experience problems running Quake II on
    some systems, because video driver and operating-system support for game functionality are
    not yet mature under Win32, and many bugs and incompatibilities remain in those
    components.</font></p>

    <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><strong>What is OpenGL?</font><font size="3" face="Arial"><br>
    About the Quake II 3D Accelerated Engine</strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="2">The hardware world is changing so fast that it is impossible for us to
    test, or even list, every 3D accelerator card with GLQuake II support. While some cards
    work extremely well, we cannot guarantee that your card will work as expected.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>What is OpenGL?<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2">OpenGL is a low-level API (Application Programming
    Interface) that works with a compatible 3D video chipset to render top quality 3D
    graphics. Some of the features you will see while using OpenGL, and a compatible 3D
    hardware video accelerator, are 16-bit graphics, colored lighting, improved translucency
    and increased game speed. </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>How GL Works:<br>
    </strong></font><font size="2">When you choose one of the GL options in the video
    selection menu, the executable relies on an OpenGL library created for a OpenGL supported
    chipset. In the video menu you can choose the 3Dfx GL library, the PowerVR GL library, or
    the default GL library that was installed with your card&#146;s drivers.</font></p>
